# AI-Powered Credit Card Fraud Detection

An end-to-end full-stack application that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using a **Random Forest** machine learning model and provides automated AI analysis using **Google Gemini AI**.

![Project Preview](/assets/credit-fraud.png)

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time Detection:** High-performance prediction using a Scikit-learn Random Forest classifier.
- **AI-Powered Reasoning:** Automated transaction analysis generated by Gemini 2.0 Flash to explain classification results.
- **Modern Dashboard:** Sleek, responsive UI with glassmorphism aesthetics, dark mode, and fluid animations.
- **PCA Feature Integration:** Supports analysis across 30 distinct transaction features including V1-V28, Time, and Amount.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React), TypeScript, CSS3 (Vanilla + Animations)
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes (Node.js)
- **Machine Learning:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Joblib
- **AI Integration:** Google Generative AI (Gemini API)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Python (v3.9+)
- Google Gemini API Key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prabesh414/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🧠 How it Works

1. **Input:** The user enters transaction details into the modern web interface.
2. **Analysis:** The frontend sends data to a Next.js API route, which spawns a Python process.
3. **ML Prediction:** The Python script loads a pre-trained `RandomForestClassifier` and `StandardScaler` to predict the likelihood of fraud.
4. **AI Reasoning:** If the model makes a prediction, the result is sent to Gemini AI, which generates a human-readable explanation based on the transaction patterns.
5. **Output:** The user receives a clear "Safe" or "Fraud" status accompanied by a detailed AI analysis.
